# Forecasting EV Charging Station Occupancy using ST-GCN and Adapter-Based Transfer Learning

This repository contains the project report for our master's thesis, which explores the forecasting of electric vehicle (EV) charging station occupancy. Using Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN) and a novel adapter-based transfer learning approach called Bridged Attention Module (BAM), we aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of predicting occupancy trends for ChargeFinder data. The focus is on leveraging spatial and temporal patterns to enhance the scalability and reliability of charging infrastructure management, particularly for Swedish EV stations.

### Also Note: 
Due to confidentiality agreements, this repository does not include the data or the trained models used in the project. Also, the files have been transferred over from a private directory, meaning they cannot be run directly as is in this directory and the actual Git history annot be viewed in this repo.
